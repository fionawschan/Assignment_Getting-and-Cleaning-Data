### The original data was transformed by:

1.  Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.
3.  Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set
4.  Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.  Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of
    each variable for each activity and each subject.

Data
----

The `tidy.txt` data file is a text file, containing space-separated
values.

The first row contains the names of the variables, which are listed and
described in the Variables section, and the following rows contain the
values of these variables.

-   `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, `y_test`,`subject_train` and
    `subject_test` contain the data from the downloaded files.
-   `x_data`, `y_data` and `'''`subject\_data\` merge the previous
    datasets to further analysis.
-   `features` contains the correct names for the x\_data dataset, which
    are applied to the column names stored in

The link to the zip file source:

The following transformations were applied to the source data:

1.  The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
2.  The measurements on the mean and standard deviation (i.e.Â signals
    containing the strings mean and std) were extracted for each
    measurement, and the others were discarded.
3.  The activity identifiers were replaced with descriptive activity
    names.
4.  The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names.
5.  From the data set in step 4, the final data set was created with the
    average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The collection of the source data and the transformations listed above
were implemented by the `run_analysis.R` R script (see `README.md` file
for usage instructions).
